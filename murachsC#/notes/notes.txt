The form designer allows you to design a form 
and implement it at the same time. Sketching the interface
on paper is paltry.

//Terms 
template -  project template, contains many features that you may use in your project.
            (windows forms app) contains many dependencies 

label - text field in form. They contain many mutable 
properties.

text box - Contains text. comprises manifold properties

button - executes function implementation when clicked

primary control - control that is used to set other components

property - settings for components

tab order - Order in which component is highlighted when pressing the tab key

focus - component that is currently selected

access key - alternative method of selecting / executing a component

//CH3 
object - region of computers memory. Requires a type and name
eg, forms and controls 

instantiation - instance of a class 

object oriented programming - Using objects to solve problems

properties - define the objects characteristics and data

methods of an object- determine the operations that can be performed 
by the object

object event - signals sent by the object to your application
that something has happened that ca be responded to 

members of an object or class- properties, methods, and events 
of an object or class

class - the code that defines the characteristics of an object.
A template for an object


-When using the Form Designer, visual studio automatically generates
 C# code that creates a new class based on the Form class. 
 Then, when you run the project a form object is instantiated
 from the new class 

-When appending a control to a form visual studio automatically 
generates C# code in the class for the form that instantiates
a control object from the appropriate class and sets the control's
default properties.

-When moving or sizing a control, visual studio automatically sets
the properties that specify the location and size of the control.

-property window only sets the properties at the start of the application, 
code allows you to alter the properties as an application is running

this keyword - current object 

- you will rarely have to refer to events since visual studio 
automatically generates the code for working with events

event handler - special type of method. Used to respond to an event

event wiring - visual studio generates a statement that connects or
wires the event handler to the event

- you are most likely to create event handlers for the default events of form
and controls

- before you start a control for an event handler , you should always 
set hte Name property of the control.

if you dont visual studio will change the name of the object in the event wiring,
but it wont change the name of the object in the method name

- avoid modifying the method declaration that's generated for you when 
you create an event handler.

- you cannot simply delete an event handler once you've added it. 
If you do, you will get an error when you try to run the application.
This error will be displayed in an error list window, and it will indicate 
that the event handler is missing.

- to handle the load event for a form double click the form itself

- event handlers are stored in the cs file for the form

- most of the code that is generated when you design a form, including 
the statement that wires the event to the event handler, is stored in the 
Designers.cs file for the form. If necessary, you can open this file to 
view or delete the event wiring 

- if you delete an event handler, you must also delete the wiring for the 
event. To do this, double click the error message in the error list and Then
delete the statement

- press tab twice to select option in the intelli-j completion list
